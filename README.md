# HW_4_1-DisplayAsterisks
Problem 1: Create a method, DisplayAsterisks, what will have an int parameter, num, and will display num asterisks in one line. For example, DisplayAsterisks(5)  should display *****. Similarly, DisplayAsterisks(12)  should display ************. 
Then, in Main, ask the user to enter the sales values for five stores and, for each one, display a row of asterisks such that each asterisk represents $100 of sales. Make sure to format the output so it matches the sample below.


Here is an example of the program's output (bolded text represents user's input):

Enter today's sales for store 1: 1000 [enter]
Enter today's sales for store 2: 800 [enter]
Enter today's sales for store 3: 500 [enter]
Enter today's sales for store 4: 1200 [enter]
Enter today's sales for store 5: 300 [enter]

SALES BAR CHART
(Each * = $100)
Store 1: **********
Store 2: ********
Store 3: *****
Store 4: ************
Store 5: ***
